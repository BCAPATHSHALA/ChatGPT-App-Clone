#### I have built ChatGPT App Clone AI using these technologies:

1. HTML

6. ExpressJS
7. OpenAI API
8. Cors

#### HTML
HTML allows users to create and structure sections, headings, links, paragraphs, and more, on a website using various tags and elements.

#### CSS
CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.

#### JS
Handle events with javascript

#### ViteJS
Vite.js is a rapid development tool for modern web projects.

#### NodeJS
Node. js is single-threaded, we use it primarily for non-blocking, event-driven servers. We can also use Node. js for traditional websites and back-end API services, as it was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

In short, NodeJS is used for server side.

#### ExpressJS
Having an API that handles the storage and movement of data is a requirement for any full-stack application, and Express makes the server creation process fast and easy.

#### OpenAI API
OpenAI is a research laboratory based in San Francisco, California. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

#### Cors library
CORS is a way to whitelist requests to your web server from certain locations, by specifying response headers like 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'. It's an important protocol for making cross-domain requests possible, in cases where there's a legitimate need to do so.
